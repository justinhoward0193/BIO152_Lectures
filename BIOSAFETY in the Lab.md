# Biology Lab Safety

##### Justin N. Howard · KCTCS · Fall 2025

# Objectives in the Lab

- Work safely with biological materials, equipment, and chemicals.  
- Understand the role of microorganisms and biological agents in lab settings.  
- Recognize safety levels and procedures for handling different organisms.  
- Develop habits that protect yourself, your classmates, and the community.

# Lab Access Policy

Occasionally, a student may need to enter the laboratory outside of scheduled class time to check an experiment, collect data, or complete a minor task. Because laboratory work involves potential risks, the following policies apply:

###  **Permission Required**  
  Students must receive prior approval from the instructor before entering the lab alone.  

---


# Lab Access Policy

###  **Authorized Tasks Only**  
  Students may only perform the specific task(s) approved by the instructor.  
  Examples of permitted low-risk tasks:  
  - Checking microbial growth on plates (observation only)  
  - Recording instrument readings or weights  
  - Collecting data from experiments already in progress  
  - Watering plants or maintaining specimens  

---

# Lab Access Policy

###  **No Hazardous Work**  
  Procedures involving flames, volatile chemicals, electrical equipment, sharps, or live microbial cultures are **not permitted** when working alone.  

###  **Time & Sign-In**  
  Students must complete lab tasks during building hours and sign in/out as directed.  

---

# Lab Access Policy

###  **Accountability**  
  Students are responsible for leaving the lab secure, with all equipment cleaned, powered down, and returned to its proper place.  

###  **Emergency Protocol**  
  In case of accident or injury, students must immediately contact campus security (or dial 911 if needed) and notify the instructor.  

---

**Summary:** Independent lab access is a privilege granted on a case-by-case basis. Safety is the priority; only routine, low-risk tasks may be completed without direct supervision.  

---

# General Safety in the Lab

- Wear appropriate protective clothing:  
  - Closed-toe shoes, no tank tops.  
  - Lab coat, gloves, and safety glasses when appropriate.  
- Tie back long hair.  
- Do not handle cultures if you are sick.  
- If you are pregnant or immunocompromised, notify the instructor.  
- Always follow instructor guidance for equipment use.  

---

# Handling Specimens

- Treat **all specimens** (plant, animal, human, or microbial) as potentially hazardous.  
- Wear gloves when handling preserved or fresh specimens.  
- Dispose of tissues and dissected material in **designated biohazard or specimen containers**.  
- Follow instructor directions for cleanup and disposal.  

---

# Open Flames & Heat Sources

- Bunsen burners, alcohol lamps, and hot plates can cause burns or fires.  
- Keep flammable materials away from open flames.  
- Tie back long hair and secure loose clothing.  
- Always turn burners off when not in use.  

---

# Electrical Safety

- Equipment such as **gel electrophoresis units**, centrifuges, and microscopes use electricity.  
- Keep cords and plugs dry; do not touch equipment with wet hands.  
- Report frayed cords or malfunctioning equipment immediately.  
- Disconnect power before adjusting equipment.  

---

# Field & Outdoor Safety

- When collecting samples outdoors (creeks, fields, woods):  
  - Wear closed-toe shoes or boots.  
  - Be alert for snakes, ticks, or other wildlife.  
  - Use gloves when handling soil, plants, or water samples.  
  - Bring water and practice sun protection as appropriate.  
  - Follow instructions for safe sample collection and transport.  

---

# Emergency & Hazard Safety

- Dispose of broken glass in the **designated sharps container**.  
- Know the location of safety equipment:  
  - First aid kit  
  - Emergency shower  
  - Fire extinguisher  
  - Eye wash station  
- Report any accidents or spills immediately.  

---

# Best Practices

**Please:**

- No eating, drinking, or applying cosmetics in lab.  
- Never mouth pipette.  
- Do not chew pens or touch your face while working.  
- Minimize exposure to all cultures and chemicals.  
- Keep your work area organized and uncluttered.  

---

# Standard Lab Practices

- Wash hands before leaving lab (required in microbiology labs).  
- Keep fingernails short (no artificial nails or tips).  
- Do not use electronics while handling biological materials.  
- Routinely disinfect work surfaces.  
- Never remove cultures, chemicals, or specimens from the lab.  

---

# Waste & Decontamination

- Dispose of waste properly:  
  - Liquid cultures → autoclave.  
  - Agar plates & solid wastes → disinfect and place in biohazard container.  
- Disinfect bench tops with 70% ethanol (or approved cleaner) at the beginning and end of class.  
- Keep tubes upright in racks.  
- Cover spills with paper towels and notify the instructor immediately.  

---

# Biosafety Levels

- Labs are categorized by **Biosafety Levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4)**.  
- Risk levels are based on:  
  - Infectivity  
  - Disease severity  
  - Transmission route  
  - Nature of the work  
- Most teaching labs use **BSL-1** or **BSL-2** organisms.  

---

# BSL-1

- Basic protection for well-characterized organisms.  
- Not known to cause disease in healthy adults.  
- Standard PPE (lab coat, gloves, eyewear) recommended.  

---

# BSL-2

- Moderate-risk organisms that may cause human disease.  
- Transmission possible by ingestion, injury, or mucous membrane exposure.  
- Restricted access during experiments.  
- Aerosol/splash procedures conducted in a **biosafety cabinet**.  
- Decontaminate equipment before removal.  

---

# Higher Containment (BSL-3 & 4)

- **BSL-3:** Agents spread by aerosols, can cause serious or lethal disease.  
  - Requires special PPE and additional containment measures.  

- **BSL-4:** Exotic, life-threatening agents with no available treatment.  
  - Restricted to maximum containment labs with positive-pressure suits.  

*Note: Teaching labs will not involve BSL-3 or BSL-4 organisms.*
