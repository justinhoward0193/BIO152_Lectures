# 31.1 Classification of Fungi
- Early attempts based on morphology  
- Molecular techniques → accurate phylogeny  
- Fungi more closely related to animals than plants  
- Diverged ~1.3 BYA from unicellular ancestor
- Common anscestor was unicellular

---

# Why Fungi Are More Like Animals than Plants
- **Heterotrophs** – absorb nutrients, cannot photosynthesize  
- **Chitin cell walls** – same material found in arthropod exoskeletons  
- **Glycogen storage** – store carbohydrates as glycogen (plants use starch)  
- **Mitochondria, not plastids** (plant and algal organelles) – no chloroplasts or photosynthetic pigments  
- **Closer DNA/phylogeny** – fungi + animals share a more recent common ancestor
- **Eukaryotic**

---

# Key Differences from Plants
- Plants: autotrophs with chlorophyll, cellulose walls, starch storage  
- Fungi: heterotrophs, chitin walls, glycogen storage  
- Fungi often partner with plants (mycorrhizae, lichens) but are **evolutionarily closer to us**  


---
  
# 31.1 Classification of Fungi
## Six monophyletic phyla:  
  - Blastocladiomycota  
  - Neocallismastigomycota  
  - Chytridiomycota  
  - Glomeromycotina  
  - Basidiomycota  
  - Ascomycota  
- Traditional Zygomycota not monophyletic  
- Microsporidia = sister group to Fungi

---

# 31.2 Fungal Forms, Nutrition, Reproduction
- 2.2–3.8 million species  
- Unicellular or multicellular  
- Ecological niches: mutualistic, parasitic, free-living  
- Sexual or asexual reproduction  
- Unusual mitosis  
- Specialized absorptive nutrition

---



# Ecological Niches of Fungi

**Mutualistic**  
- Both partners benefit  
- Example: mycorrhizal fungi + plants (nutrients ↔ sugars)

---

**Parasitic**  
- One benefits, the host is harmed  
- Example: *Cordyceps* infecting insects


---

**Free-living (Saprophytic)**  
- Independent; decompose dead material  
- Example: *Rhizopus* (bread mold) in soil or food




---

**Growth Forms**
- Yeasts (unicellular)  
- Mycelia (multicellular hyphae)  
- Hyphae: septa (perforated), cytoplasmic flow

---

**Cell Walls**
- Chitin (also in arthropods)

**Mycelium**
- High SA:V ratio, rapid nutrient uptake  
- Fruiting bodies form under stress

---
# Why Fungi Have a High SA:V Ratio

- **SA:V ratio = Surface Area to Volume**  
- Fungal hyphae are long, thin, and highly branched → **huge surface area**  
- More surface = more sites for **nutrient absorption**  
- Small volume = nutrients don’t have far to travel inside the cell  

**Analogy:**  
- A **sponge** (lots of surface) absorbs water quickly  
- A **brick** (low surface) does not  

## Contributes to fungi being **efficient decomposers** in ecosystems.

---


# Nuclear Organization
- Monokaryotic (1 nucleus)  
- Dikaryotic (2 nuclei, not fused)  
- Heterokaryotic (genetically distinct nuclei)  
- Homokaryotic (genetically identical)

**Mitosis**
- Nucleus is unit of division  
- Spindle forms inside nuclear envelope  
- No centrioles (except chytrids)

**Reproduction**
- Sexual: fusion of haploid hyphae  
- Dikaryotic stage before diploid  
- Fruiting bodies form reproductive structures  
- Four main reproductive structures:  
  - Zoospores  
  - Zygosporangia  
  - Basidia  
  - Asci  

**Spores**
- Sexual or asexual  
- Dispersed mainly by wind  
- Germinate into new mycelium

---

# 31.3 Fungal Ecology
- Principal decomposers (with bacteria)  
- Break down cellulose and lignin  
- Release C, N, P back into ecosystems

**Carnivorous Fungi**
- *Pleurotus ostreatus* paralyzes nematodes

**Symbioses**
- Obligate vs facultative  
- Pathogens vs parasites vs commensals vs mutualists

---

**Endophytes**
- Live inside plants  
- Can deter herbivores, increase nutrients  
- Ryegrass + endophyte = reduced aphids

**Lichens**
- Fungus + algae/cyanobacteria  
- Fungus provides moisture, structure  
- Photosynthetic partner provides carbs  
- Sensitive to pollutants


---

**Mycorrhizae**
- 90% plant families  
- Extend root system, exchange sugars/nutrients  
- Arbuscular (Glomeromycotina)  
- Ectomycorrhizae (forest trees, basidiomycetes)

**Animal Mutualisms**
- Ruminants: gut fungi digest cellulose  
- Leaf-cutter ants: fungal gardens

---

# 31.4 Fungal Parasites & Pathogens
- Human/animal issues:  
  - Allergens (spores)  
  - Mycoses (direct infections)  
  - Mycotoxins (toxic metabolites)  
- Mycotoxins:  
  - *Aspergillus flavus* (aflatoxins)  
  - *Penicillium* (antibiotic production)  
  - *Ustilago maydis* (corn smut)

**Diseases**
- Humans: athlete’s foot, ringworm, candidiasis  
- Amphibians: chytridiomycosis (*Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis*)  
- Plants: rice blast, wheat rust, *Armillaria* root rot

---

# 31.5 Basidiomycota
- 32,000+ species  
- Mushrooms, rusts, smuts  
- Basidium = club-shaped reproductive structure

**Life Cycle**



- Haploid spore → primary mycelium (monokaryotic)  
- Plasmogamy → dikaryotic secondary mycelium  
- Basidiocarp (mushroom) forms  
- Basidia on gills → karyogamy → meiosis → basidiospores

---

# 31.6 Ascomycota
- 64,000+ species  
- Yeasts, molds, truffles, morels  
- Includes pathogens: chestnut blight, Dutch elm disease  
- Penicillin-producing *Penicillium*  
- Ascus = saclike reproductive structure

**Reproduction**
- Asexual: conidiophores → conidia  
- Sexual: plasmogamy → dikaryotic cells → ascocarp → asci → karyogamy + meiosis + mitosis → 8 ascospores

**Yeasts**
- Unicellular ascomycetes  
- Budding/fission, sometimes sexual cycle  
- Ferment carbohydrates: bread, beer, wine  
- *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* = key model system

---

# 31.7 Glomeromycotina
- ~200 species  
- Obligate symbionts with plant roots (AM fungi)  
- Crucial for plant colonization of land  
- No aboveground fruiting structures

---

# 31.8 Traditional Zygomycetes
- ~1,000 species  
- Non-monophyletic  
- Bread molds, some pathogens

**Asexual**
- Sporangiophores with sporangia → haploid spores

**Sexual**
- Opposite mating types form gametangia  
- Plasmogamy → zygosporangium  
- Karyogamy → diploid zygote → meiosis → haploid spores  
- Example: *Rhizopus* (black bread mold)

---

# 31.9 Chytridiomycota & Relatives
- Aquatic, flagellated fungi  
- Zoospores (motile, flagellated)  
- Ancestral lineage of fungi

---

# 31.10 Other Groups
**Blastocladiomycetes**  
- Aquatic/terrestrial  
- Parasites of plants/animals/fungi  
- Zoospores, alternation of generations (*Allomyces*)  

**Neocallimastigomycota**  
- Anaerobic gut fungi in herbivores  
- Hydrogenosomes (no mitochondria)  
- Digest cellulose/lignin  
- HGT of cellulase from bacteria  

**Microsporidia**  
- Obligate intracellular parasites  
- Tiny genomes, no mitochondria  
- Polar tubes inject spore contents into host cells
